# iMessage Tapback recreations

SVG recreations of Apple’s new colorful default Tapbacks in iOS 18

I also plan to do the older monochrome Tapbacks, but I may never get around to
it.

PRs are welcome to `colorful` and `mono` :)

## Examples

<img src="./colorful/haha.svg" alt="Haha Tapback" width="44" height="44" />

## License

The original Tapback images are intellectual property of Apple Inc.

The recreations are copyright © 2024 iLynxcat, released under the MIT license.
